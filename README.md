# webpack-example

Example Webpack configuration code from the
[SurviveJS - Webpack](https://www.amazon.com/SurviveJS-Webpack-apprentice-Juho-Vepsäläinen-ebook/dp/B06XWZZGBS)
book.

There are two scripts so far:
* `npm run start` runs webpack-dev-server and refreshes after any changes.
* `npm run build` builds the app in production mode.
